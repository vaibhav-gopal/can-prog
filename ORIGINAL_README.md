# canprog

Command-line tool to flashing devices by CAN-BUS.

## Main features
- Support STM32 CAN-BUS ROM bootloader
- Easily expand with other CAN-BUS protocols
- Support iHEX and binary format files
- Object oriented architecture
- Command-line interface
- Socket-CAN driver for CAN-BUS low level operations

## Todo
- [ ] Other microcontroller protocols
- [ ] Other CAN-BUS interfaces
- [ ] Autocalculating sectors for erasing (for STM32)
- [ ] Memory write protect/unprotect (form STM32)
- [ ] TDD tests

## Requirements
- Compatible PC CAN-BUS adapter 
- Linux + Python3
- Enabled SocketCAN driver
- Board with STM32 with CAN interface

### Driver instalation
```
modprobe can
modprobe can-raw
modprobe slcan
slcand -o -c -f -s4 /dev/ttyUSB0 slcan0
ip link set up slcan0
```

### App instalation
```
sudo pip install canprog
```

## Usage:
### General usage + configuration
```
usage: canprog [-h] [--verbose] [--version] [-n NAME] [-i {socketcan}]
               [-f {hex,bin}]
               {stm32} ...

others:
  -h, --help      show this help message and exit
  --verbose       enable verbose output
  --version       show program's version number and exit

configuration:
  -n NAME         interface name (default: slcan0)
  -i {socketcan}  interface type (default: socketcan)
  -f {hex,bin}    file format (default: hex)

protocols:
  {stm32}
    stm32         STM32 ROM bootloader
```
### STM32 bootloader options
```
usage: canprog stm32 [-h] {write,read,erase,go,lock,unlock} ...

others:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

commands:
  {write,read,erase,go,lock,unlock}
    write               write file to target memory
    read                read target memory to file
    erase               erase target memory
    go                  start program application
    lock                enable readout protection
    unlock              disable readout protection
    speed               change the can baud rate the boot rom uses
```
### Usage examples:
```
canprog stm32 write image.hex
canprog -f bin stm32 write image.bin -a 0x08000000
canprog stm32 read dump.hex -s 0x200
canprog stm32 lock
canprog stm32 erase -P 0 1 2 3
```
